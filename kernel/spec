Virtuics is designed to be a highly virtualized system, offering many services to virtualize
and abstract hardware, even across processor architectures.
The Monos microkernel is designed to provide the minimum amount of services for the driver layer
to utilize. It integrates memory management, an IPC subsystem, and a process management subsystem.
Drivers handle everything else using a client-server model (IPC), from VGA to filesystem management.
Only the kernel can talk to the drivers, and functions must be accessed through the kernel using system 
calls.
Unlike how everything in linux works, by accessing a file at the top layer (even if it may be virtual) - 
eg, accessing a drive through /dev/<device>, Virtuics requires programs to access resources via system 
calls or IPC pipes.
