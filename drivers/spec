Drivers are found in the /drivers directory.
Each driver is to have its own subdirectory within /drivers.
Each driver must have a config file named config.ini with the following format:
    NAME:<driver name>
    FILENAME:<filename>

Drivers are the first programs to load after the kernel.
Drivers are to provide interfaces to the kernel, and only the kernel
via IPC pipes which the kernel knows how to communicate with.
Depending on the subsystem, the kernel may include system calls to
allow user space programs to indirectly interface with the driver.
